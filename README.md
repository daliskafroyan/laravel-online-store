# Laravel Online Store

Project based exercise of building a simplified business flow of electronic commerce

## Background


As I mainly working in pure front-end with JS as my lingua franca, I felt this urge to learn another popular framework to expand my experience. The best way to learn a framework / programming language is to build project out of it, so, here it is!
## Application Scope

Home page will display a welcome message and some images.
- About page will display information about the online store and developers.
- Products page will display the available products information. In addition, you can click on a specific product
and see its information.
- Categories page will display the available products in the scope of respective categories **(NOT YET DONE)**
- Cart page will display the products added to the cart and the total price to be paid. In addition, a user can
remove products from the cart and make purchases.
- Login page will display a form to allow users to log in to the application.
- Register page will display a form to allow users to sign up for accounts.
- My orders page will display the orders placed by the logged in user.
- Admin panel will contain sections to manage the storeâ€™s products (create, update, delete, and list them).


## Roadmap
Because I never had any experience with PHP before, the work that I expected to be done in 2 days perhaps need to be extended for one another day. But no worries, this project can be serve perfectly but still need improvement from the feature side

- Serve image in Cloudinary

- Build Categories page

- Create Images table and it's relation with Product and Categories


## Tech Stack
